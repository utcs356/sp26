### Communication

We will use [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/89721) for all course announcements, general questions, assignment clarifications, student discussions, and course-related communication.


***

### Office Hours

The instructor and TA will hold regular office hours to assist with course material, projects, and any related concerns.
To ensure office hours are productive and fair for all students, please follow these guidelines:

* **Come Prepared**: Make a genuine effort to solve problems on your own before attending office hours.
For project-related questions, thoroughly read the assignment description and attempt an implementation first.
Note that instructors will guide you toward solutions but will not write code for you.

* **Respect the Queue**: Office hours operate on a queue system with a 10-minute limit per student.
You are welcome to rejoin the queue if you need additional help.

These policies ensure that all students have equal opportunity to receive support.

Your final grade will be based on the following components:

* **Exams (40%)**: One midterm exam and one final exam.

This course includes six hands-on programming assignments designed to reinforce key concepts.
The following policies apply:

#### Individual Work
All programming assignments must be completed individually.
Collaboration with other students on assignment code is not permitted.

#### Deadlines and Late Submissions
Each assignment will be due approximately 2-3 weeks after it is released.
**Starting early significantly improves your chances of success.**

**Late submissions will incur a 10% penalty per day** (including weekends).

**Exception requests for late submissions must follow these strict guidelines:**
* **Planned absences or conflicts**: Contact the instructor **at least two weeks in advance**.
* **Emergencies** (medical, family, etc.): Contact the instructor **immediately when the emergency occurs**.
* **Requests made after the deadline or after the event has occurred will NOT be accepted.**

This policy ensures fairness and allows the instructor to make appropriate arrangements in advance.
If you anticipate any conflicts with assignment deadlines, reach out proactively.

#### Academic Integrity

Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated and will be handled according to the [University of Texas policies and procedures](https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/index.php).
